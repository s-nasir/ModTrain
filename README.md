# Project ModTrain
*Training Simulation for Security & Concierge Industry*

---

## Overview

Welcome to the Training Simulation Game project, a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance training experiences for new and experienced employees in the Security & Concierge industry. This interactive simulation game is meticulously crafted to infuse efficiency, quality, and accessibility into corporate training programs, ultimately addressing the shortcomings of traditional training methods.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Module Style**: The game's modular approach allows trainees to navigate through various scenarios, each adapting based on their choices, creating an engaging and dynamic learning experience.

- **Realistic Scenarios**: Trainees can immerse themselves in simulated emergency and daily scenarios, replicating real-world challenges they may encounter in their roles.

- **Decision-Based Learning**: Protocols within the game are presented as step-by-step processes, prompting users to make choices. Wrong decisions result in module failure with explanatory feedback, while correct choices advance users to the next step, fostering decision-making skills.

- **Addressing Industry Challenges**: The project addresses common problems in current training methods, such as memory-based testing and the exclusion of certain demographics, by providing a more comprehensive and inclusive training experience.
